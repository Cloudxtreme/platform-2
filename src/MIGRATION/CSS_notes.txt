/* GLOBAL */
Page views should have it's name on the id, eg: id="settings";


/* Entries */
Base or old entry structure is based on avatar, content and actions;
Entry templates should be divided by content & styled by the entrylist/mesagelist that contains them;
All messagelists have the class .messagelist;
All messagelist's entry containers have the class .entry-container;
The messages (like inbox after toggle) belong in a .message-container;

Entry sub actions structure:
InboxMessageList.toggle() -> MessageEntry.action() -> SubEntries (eg: new SubNoteEntry());

Entries that belong to other entries/messages (eg: notes & notifications), are called sub entries. 
Sub entries are always associated with actions. So the subentry structure is:

<message-sub-actions>
	<action-lists>
	  ..<action-list (note-list)>
		..<subentry>
			  ..
			  ..

Notes also have another component, the composenote. On message context, it should also be inside the message-sub-actions, in note-content.
