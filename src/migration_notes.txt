# MIGRATION CHANGES #

models/message
-> removed collections/notifications dependency because it was conflicting 
	with notification & notifications

models/channel
-> removed contacts & notifications dependency because it's not clear where 
	they are used.

views/entry
-> removed noteentry widget dependency. Does it make sense? Shouldn't message
	be the one with the noteentry reference instead of an entry?

Session
-> updated base translation just to fallback when there is no polyglot
-> commented Router, Root & collections/accounts due to looping issues



/** Left to be updated **/
.net stuff
hardcoded ajax calls
Fix the goddamn translations
Sort out the widgets/non widgets
Group or ungroup views like /settings and /widgets
Remove all models and widgets, add them as running the code
