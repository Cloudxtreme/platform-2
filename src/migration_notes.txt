# MIGRATION NOTES #

DASHBOARD:
Are all the functions needed in MessagesCounters & Widget?
Entry is way too complicated

/** Left to be updated **/
.net stuff
hardcoded ajax calls
Fix the goddamn translations
Sort out the widgets/non widgets
Group or ungroup views like /settings and /widgets
Remove all models and widgets, add them as running the code
Coworkerslist, drafts list, etc have similar logic but are not reusing it
